       "'Nice, open bar with great views of the strip and golf course.  Patio seating also.  Nice happy hour prices.  Had the carnitas nachos...very good.  And they serve breakfast all day.  Not noisy or smoky,We usually stop here after using the driving range. The place is very clean,including the restrooms. The food is good and the employees are friendly. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. The view of the Strip is a plus.There are numerous TV\\'s to watch sports.\\nThis would be a great place to watch the football games after hitting a bucket of balls.,The first time we ate here everything was good.  Since that first we have tried it four more times.  The service and the food have been a big disappointment.  On the last visit I had to return my burger because it was not cooked.  When they brought it back it had an unusual odor but I ate it anyway.  Sick for three days.  Great location but we wont eat here again.,So I took my daughter there for breakfast and some practice. Eaten at this place before and it was good. Service was decent.  Waitress says cooks not here he is late. I asked if she has apple juice and ice tea, apple juice for my daughter. She shot me a look and in a dismissive voice says we don\\'t have any.  I said forget it and left. How bout ya don\\'t open if you don\\'t have a cook? How about you are at a driving range you need some kind of something for kids. Not all kids drink soda. Get it together, get some people who care.,This restaurant has a new name it used to be called upper deck grill. Previous owner in restaurant was very friendly and have great menu. Staff and owner were very Golf friendly had great atmosphere and wonderful menu. New staff is not golf friendly and doesn\\'t have same golf atmosphere. Taylor made should address this. Menu and prices are not as good as previous owners. Took way to long to get good and my appetizer came out with meal\\nWhen I complained they just didn\\'t respond.,Happy hours 3-5pm. Beer started $3, buffalo wings with vegetable sticks & cheese $6.00. Good price with decent food. Nice view and actually you can seat at the patio site. Staffs are nice and very friendly. I saw some  tourist comes enjoying view and hang out at the range area.\\nAtmosphere is clean and welcome to everyone even if you are not a golfer.,After a cold round of golf we snuggled up to a great bowl of chili and the most amazing pb&j.  The fresh lemonade was crazy good.  If that wasn\\'t enough to get you in the door, the service was extremely nice and attentive to the needs of my kids.  We look forward to trying breakfast soon.,Service outstanding (Brenda and Jennifer). Braised pork with hot sweet pickles was yummy. Next to the Taylormade Golf Experience. Very enjoyable conversation and food.,Awsome food ,great service. Great place to hang out & have a brew ! Really nice & helpful staff. Defiantly coming back.,Beautiful golf course as well as an amazing breakfast before or after you play. Prices are incredibly reasonable, food is wonderful, and the staff is so friendly and attentive. If you\\'re around this area, come grab breakfast or lunch!,Burgers great! Service great! Beer selection good. Music playlist is annoying at best. Fix the playlist and you get more stars from me.,There is nothing more relaxing then looking over a golf course while enjoying lunch. The Flight Decks\\' location across Las Vegas Blvd from Town Square gives the added bonus of a Strip view. With an impressive menu which boasts a wonderful array of outside the box appetizers like fried green tomatoes and gourmet burgers & sandwiches, plus breakfast selections all day, I would like this newer eatery to remain my own secret dining spot, but I am certain it won\\'t be hidden away for much longer. I thoroughly enjoyed my gourmet burger, fries, spinach salad w hot bacon dressing and tea. I shall return!,Awesomely constructed carnitas nachos! With cheese sauce and beans! And they\\'re only $6 during happy hour (remember there are 2 HHs here - one in the morning and one in the afternoon).\\n\\nAlso an incredible $6 wing special as well (mentioned in my first review) and I always ask that they smash the hottest buffalo and BBQ sauces together when I order them. 10 jumbo wings means 60-cent wings every day if you happy hour here. \\n\\nReally delicious Huevos Rancheros available all day. The kitchen here is something else!\\n\\nTheir \"Flight Deck Lager\" is a draft beer made for Taylor Made by Anheuser-Busch, and is similar to a Cass or OB beer but a bit lighter, with a clean aftertaste. It\\'s $3/pint all day long.\\n\\nGreat, friendly service every time. And a bright, airy, north-facing environment with a horizonal view of the Strip and plenty of HDTVs, this is a *perfect* starting point for any bachelor, bachelorette or reunion weekend. Not to mention there\\'s a full-fledged driving range 10 feet in front of you. (Locals: ask about the amazing bottomless bucket of balls special.)\\n\\nAlways easy parking, spotless bathrooms and friendly staff. Gotta love corporate-owned gone right! \\n\\nThis place should be packed, and I\\'m always surprised to see when it\\'s not! For now, it\\'s our little secret...'"
